# Smart_Watch
Collaborators: Gilles Hanin, Bastien Glauser, Jonas Glatz, Lukas Schreiner
This project was created in a hackaton that was part of the SHSG Coding Bootcamp at the University of St. Gallen.

This project uses a script that steers a Raspberry Pi 3 that imports the events from a google calender.
LEDs on the watch light up whenever there is an event in that respective hour so you can see when which of the next 12 hours are blocked.
