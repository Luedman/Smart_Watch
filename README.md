# Smart_Watch
A smart watch that displays the blocked time from your google calendar
Collaborators: Gilles Hanin, Bastien Glauser, Jonas Glatz, Lukas Schreiner

This project uses a script that steers a Raspberry Pi 3 that imports the events in a google calender.
LEDs on the watch light up whereever there is an event in that hour.
